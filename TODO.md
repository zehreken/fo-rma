* Fix Sine oscillation
* Add chromatic abberation post process effect
* Add "Dev Mode" to fo-rma
* Add material support for the editor
* Group objects by material type before rendering
* An idea: Since you have many post-process effects now, you can try to apply them for sound as well. It is both signal processing anyways, for instance adding noise to the the image and sound can go well together. Or the step function for sound volume for instance. Or pixelate, I don't know how it would sound and of course the permutations.
